;  Inherited from .Spll.SpllGlossary
;  $firstkey() this method is called when the glossary has received the first key for the current field

;  we must turn off first key as this message is managed by us
;  the external object does not maintain a first key state so we must maintain it
;  if we don't turn off $sendfirstkey we will receive calls for all subsequent key presses
Calculate $cinst.$sendfirstkey as kFalse

;  call the current fields window to inform it about the first key event
Do refFirstKeyRecipient.$firstkey(refActiveField)
